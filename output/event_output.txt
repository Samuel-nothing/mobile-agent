  "[orchestrator] Starting the first subgoal: - [ID:f8575eb8-19ef-429e-8b9b-f08e59ac0cf2]: Open the Gmail app : \u23f3.",
  "[cortex] Analyzing previous agent thoughts: No previous agent thoughts are available, as this is the first step. The current subgoal is to open the Gmail app. The current screen is showing the Nothing Weather app. I need to find the Gmail app and launch it. I will use the `find_packages` tool to find the package name for Gmail, and then `launch_app` to open it.",
  "[executor] I am using the `find_packages` tool to locate the Gmail application on the device. I need to specify the app name as \"Gmail\" so the tool can return the correct package name.",
  "[executor] Packages found successfully (Extracted the package name for Gmail from the provided data.): com.google.android.gm",
  "[cortex] Analyzing previous agent thoughts: The `find_packages` tool successfully returned the Gmail package name: `com.google.android.gm`. I will now use this package name with the `launch_app` tool to open the Gmail application, directly addressing the current subgoal.",
  "[executor] I am launching the Gmail app using its package name to proceed with the task of checking emails.",
  "[cortex] Analyzing previous agent thoughts: The last action successfully launched Gmail. The current UI shows Gmail's main screen, confirming the first subgoal is complete. I will now tap the 'Compose' button to proceed with creating a new email.",
  "[cortex] Analyzing previous agent thoughts: The previous `tap` action failed due to incorrect selector formatting. I am correcting this by providing only the `resource_id` of the 'Compose' button to the `tap` tool. This should properly trigger the compose action and advance the subgoal.",
  "[executor] I am tapping on the 'Compose' button to initiate a new email, using its resource_id as the selector, to correct the previous error and advance the subgoal.",
  "[cortex] Analyzing previous agent thoughts: The previous `tap` action to compose an email was successful, and the current screen shows the email composition interface. This confirms the completion of the first two subgoals. The next subgoal is to enter the recipient's email. I will use the `input_text` tool to type \"samuel.chang@nothing.tech\" into the 'To' field, which is identified by `resource_id: com.google.android.gm:id/peoplekit_autocomplete_search_bar_wrapper` to progress through the plan.",
  "[executor] I am entering the recipient's email address 'samuel.chang@nothing.tech' into the 'To' field, identified by resource_id 'com.google.android.gm:id/peoplekit_autocomplete_search_bar_wrapper'.",
  "[executor] Typed 'samuel.chang@nothing.tech'.\nHere is the whole content of input with id 'com.google.android.gm:id/peoplekit_autocomplete_search_bar_wrapper' : None",
  "[cortex] Analyzing previous agent thoughts: The `input_text` action partially succeeded, as the email is now visible as a suggestion. However, the executor feedback indicated the field content was \"None\" before, which is a contradiction. The current UI hierarchy confirms that the text \"samuel.chang@nothing.tech\" is present as an autocomplete suggestion. To complete the subgoal, I need to tap on this suggestion to confirm it as the recipient. I am correcting the previous error by explicitly selecting the suggested email address, rather than relying solely on `input_text` to finalize the entry.",
  "[executor] I am tapping on the email suggestion \"samuel.chang@nothing.tech\" to select it as the recipient, as the `input_text` action only provided it as a suggestion.",
  "[cortex] Analyzing previous agent thoughts: The email address `samuel.chang@nothing.tech` has been successfully entered in the 'To' field. The subgoal 'Enter your own email address as the recipient' is now complete. I will now proceed to the next subgoal, which is to enter 'Lunch invite' as the subject, by using `input_text` into the `Subject` field identified by `resource_id: com.google.android.gm:id/subject`.",
  "[executor] I am entering \"Lunch invite\" as the subject of the email in the subject field.",
  "[executor] Typed 'Lunch invite'.\nHere is the whole content of input with id 'com.google.android.gm:id/subject' : 'Lunch invite'",
  "[cortex] The previous action successfully entered 'Lunch invite' as the subject. The subgoal 'Enter \"Lunch invite\" as the subject' is complete. I will now input the email body text into the 'Compose email' field to complete the next subgoal 'Add details about the lunch in the email body'.",
  "[executor] I am inputting the email body text into the 'Compose email' field. I am using 'Compose email' as the text_input_resource_id, assuming it refers to the input field's identifier.",
  "[executor] Failed to input text \"Hi Samuel, I'd like to invite you for lunch today. Let me know if you are free. Best,\". Reason: Element not found",
  "[cortex] Analyzing previous agent thoughts: The previous attempt to input text into the email body failed because the element with text \"Compose email\" was not found. I am correcting this by identifying a more suitable `resource_id` for the email body field from the UI hierarchy. The `resource_id: com.google.android.gm:id/wc_body_layout` appears to be the most appropriate container for the email body. I will use this `resource_id` with the `input_text` tool to add the lunch invite details, aiming to complete the current subgoal.",
  "[executor] I am inputting the lunch invite details into the email body using the identified resource ID.",
  "[executor] Typed \"Hi Samuel, I'd like to invite you for lunch today. Let me know if you are free. Best,\".\nHere is the whole content of input with id 'com.google.android.gm:id/wc_body_layout' : None",
  "[cortex] The previous action successfully added the email body. The subgoal 'Add details about the lunch in the email body' is complete. I will now tap the 'Send' button, identified by `resource_id: com.google.android.gm:id/send` and `accessibilityText: \"Send\"`, to send the email and complete the final subgoal.",
  "[executor] I am tapping the \"Send\" button to send the email.",
  "[cortex] The previous action successfully sent the email, as confirmed by the 'Sent' toast bar in the UI. All subgoals related to sending the lunch invite email have now been completed.",
  "[orchestrator] All subgoals have been successfully completed, leading to the successful sending of the lunch invite email."

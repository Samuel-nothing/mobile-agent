My current subgoal is to open the Settings app. I will use the `find_packages` tool to find the package name of the Settings app and then use `launch_app` to open it. This is a direct and efficient way to achieve the subgoal.

ℹ 💭 [cortex] Analyzing previous agent thoughts: I have swiped up once, and the last visible item was "Special features". I need to find "Battery". Looking at the current UI, I still don't see "Battery". The last visible item is now "About phone". Since I have not seen "Battery" yet and the list appears to be scrollable, I will perform another swipe up action. I will remember "About phone" as the last visible item to detect if I'm stuck in a loop.

ℹ 💭 [cortex] Analyzing previous agent thoughts: I have swiped up twice, and "Battery" is still not visible. I have also observed "About phone" as the last visible item, suggesting I might have reached the end of the scrollable content. I will now pivot my strategy to use the search bar within the Settings app to directly find "Battery". I will tap the "Search" text field to activate it.

ℹ 💭 [cortex] Analyzing previous agent thoughts: I have swiped up twice and "Battery" is still not visible. I also previously made an error in the `tap` tool call by passing both `resource_id` and `text` directly inside the `target` object, instead of nesting them within an `id` or `text` field. I need to correct this.

Based on the current UI, I see a search bar with the text "Search" and resource ID `com.android.settings:id/search_bar_title`. I will tap on this element to activate the search function and then use `input_text` to search for "Battery".

ℹ 💭 [cortex] Analyzing previous agent thoughts: My previous tap action, despite the executor's feedback, successfully brought me to the Battery settings page. The current UI hierarchy clearly indicates this by showing elements like 'usage_summary' with the text '11 %' and the collapsing toolbar with accessibility text 'Battery'. This means the previous subgoal of navigating to the battery section is complete. Now, I will extract the battery level from the 'usage_summary' element.
